<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/dgtaheno)

My artillery Genius is working perfect but... I want to connect it with <a href="https://github.com/OctoPrint/">Octoprint</a> and also to go some steps further in my 3D printer & firmware development.

Why should you update your artillery firmware?

- Save to EEPROM
- P.I.D. Autotune option for hotend – also added tuned PID settings for hotend and heatbed.
- Manual Bed leveling
- Linear Advance 1.5 enabled and configured K Factor to 0.13
- S Curve Acceleration and Adaptive Step Smoothing is enabled
- Added preheat presets for different types of materials.
- Babystepping Z enabled
- Quick Home enabled for faster homing
- Changed Feedrate and Acceleration values for smooth and silent operation

So I went directly to https://marlinfw.org/ and learnt how to customize the latest firmware so it is perfectly fitting my 3D printer.

In order to run Marlin firmware I need also to customize and update Artillery Genius <a href="https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware">TFT</a> firmware.

So the following files were generated for this project:

<li><a href="https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/Marlin%202.0.9.3.hex">Marlin 2.0.9.3.hex</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/SD%20TFT%20update.zip">SD TFT update.zip</a></li>

### Built With

This is the software used to create this project:

- [Visual Studio Core](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Platform.io](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)(VS Code extension)
- [Auto Build Marlin](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/auto_build_marlin.html)(VS Code extension)
- [Marlin Firmware](https://marlinfw.org)
- [Big TreeTech TFT Firmware](https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-TouchScreenFirmware)
- [Prusa slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

Please prepare your printer in a clean space, a computer and a USB cable to connect the computer to the motherboard.

### Prerequisites

<span style="color:red">Please note that to update the firmware it is necessary to open Artillery Genius 3D printer cover, which voids the warranty!!!
Do it at your own risk, I will take no liability for any caused damages.</span>

Remove the bottom cover.

The cable between TFT touchscreen and the motherboard needs to be removed in order to get a connection from the computer and flash the board firmware, it is usually glued, I found super helpful using a hair dryer to melt the glue, so it the connector comes out easy.

With the firmware flashed, you can now connect the TFT cable back to its original position and put the bottom cover back.

### Installation

First, you need to flash the board firmware. I am using Prusa Slicer to flash.

1. Download the [Marlin 2.0.9.3.hex](https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/Marlin%202.0.9.3.hex) for Artillery Genius firmware
2. Open Prusa Slicer
3. Go to Configuration -> Flash printer firmware
4. Select the Marlin 2.0.9.3.hex file provided, and choose the correct serial port for your printer.
5. Click Flash! and wait for the process to finish.

After flashing the firmware, make sure you first run the [G-Code](https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/Reset%20Settings.gcode) provided, to reset to factory defaults and clear EEPROM. Copy the .gcode file on your SD Card and “print” it.
You can also run the following commands in sequence:

M502
M500
M501

Second you need to update TFT firmware:

1. Download [TFT Firmware](https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/SD%20TFT%20update.zip) for Artillery Genius
2. Copy the contents of [TFT Firmware](https://github.com/dgtaheno/Imail/blob/main/SD%20TFT%20update.zip) for Artillery Genius folder in the root of the SD Card
3. Plug your SD Card in your printer
4. Start the printer and wait for the flashing process to finish.

The printer will reboot when finished

You can close again the bottom cover and start having fun.

In case of issues, you can always download original firmware from https://www.artillery3d.com/pages/downloads

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

I recommend you start working with this new firmwares following some calibrations:

https://3dprintbeginner.com/3d-printer-calibration/

And start working with it to become familiar with all functionalities.
